This app allows a user with permission to browse previously made blogs post along with create their own blog post. An authentication is required where the user must sign in to thier account. By clicking "New Article", the user is prompted to add a title and create a body. When "Create" is clicked, the post is put into the nav of articles and a timestamp is added. Articles can be browsed through in the nav and the "Hide Articles" button can collapse the nav to focus on the text.

Any user without permission is able to browse the many articles about whale facts. Details like roles, threats, social lives, migration, and common facts. Each has their respective title, when the post was made, then their body of information.
